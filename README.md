# Carpet Mod 1.12.2-Modified
Yes. It is called 'Carpet Mod 1.12.2 Modified'.

I hadn't pushed cuz my network has some errors.(and i need to learn how this thing works)

I promise I'll update the descriptions of every setting when I release a release version.

I'm not gonna add too many un-vanilla stuff. Go play your 1.16, 1.17 and 1.18, u have datapacks, right? Go ahead, use them to add what u want!

I'm wondering why people use modified carpet mod to add things which can be added by using datapacks.

## New Features

More debug logs about the dragon fight.

### More `<settings>`

`moreDragonFightLogs`: 

Now your console is clean.

`shulkersPostGeneration`:

A feature that Mojang added in a higher version.

`creativePlayersLoadChunks`: 

literal meaning.

`dragonCrashingFix`: 

Fixed the path find and the dragon breath. The server won't crash anymore and you can freeze the dragon freely if you enable this!(you don't have to worry about placing wrong nodes)


`doDragonFightNBTTagSave`: 

Enable this to prevent the dragon fight NBT tags from being saved.


`autoDisableLegacyDragonFightScan`: 

Disable this to make the game check the dragon fight status more than once. You need to restart the server to make it work.

WARNING! the debug logs might spam massivly into your console!

`dispenserCrashFix`: 

Fixes the problem that when you try to place a shulker box above/below the build height limit, the server will crash.

### **Type `/carpet <settings>` to see more info!**

## To-do list

**Settings:**

`survivalPlayersLoadChunks`: Uh-uh.

`netherPortalLoadChunks`: I did try to build portal chunk loaders in 1.12.2, and I was wondering why it didn't work.

`pearlLoadChunks`: Nah I'm not a pearl cannon guy.


**Commands: **

`/nbtset <path> <value>`: its tough work.

`/data <get, merge, modify, remove> ...`: WE NEED IT...Uh, yes, we need it.

##Future ideas

Add some cool stuff from [Carpet-TIS-Addition](https://github.com/TISUnion/Carpet-TIS-Addition)

*I will follow the license, don't worry.*

It's pathetic that nobody wanna add the features they added in a higher version to an old version though they always say 'oh wow we love 1.12.2'. 1.15.2 is somehow abandoned, too.
