Fixed the path find and the dragon breath. The server won't crash anymore and you can freeze the dragon if you enable this!


`doDragonFightNBTTagSave`: 

Enable this to prevent the dragon fight NBT tags from being saved.


`autoDisableLegacyDragonFightScan`: 

Disable this to make the game check the dragon fight status more than once. You need to restart the server to make it work.
