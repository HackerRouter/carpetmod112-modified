# Carpet Mod 1.12.2-modified
Yes.

I hadn't pushed cuz my network has some errors.

## New Features

More debug logs about dragon fight.

### More `<settings>`

`dragonCrashingFix`: 

Fixed the path find and the dragon breath. The server won't crash anymore and you can freeze the dragon freely if you enable this!(you don't have to worry about placing wrong nodes)


`doDragonFightNBTTagSave`: 

Enable this to prevent the dragon fight NBT tags from being saved.


`autoDisableLegacyDragonFightScan`: 

Disable this to make the game check the dragon fight status more than once. You need to restart the server to make it work.

WARNING! the debug logs might spam massivly into your console!

`dispenserCrashFix` (Haven't released this): 

Fixes the problem that when you try to place a shulker box above/below the build height limit, the server will crash.
