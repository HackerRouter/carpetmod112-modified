# Carpet Mod 1.12.2-Modified
Yes. It is called 'Carpet Mod 1.12.2 Modified'.

I hadn't pushed cuz my network has some errors.(and i need to learn how this thing works)

I promise I'll update the descriptions of every setting when I release a release version. (toooo mayn grammah meeestake arghhh)

I'm not gonna add too many un-vanilla stuff. Go play your 1.16, 1.17 and 1.18, u have datapacks, right? Go ahead, use them to add what u want.

## New Features

More debug logs about the dragon fight.

2 unlisted new settings which prove that a new feature in 1.19+ won't work on 1.12.2

Fixed `watchdogFix`.(Have you ever experienced the pain you debug the game for more than 1 minute and the server crashes cuz watchdog is on?)[Not Released]

### More `<settings>`

`dragonFightAutoCheck`: inspired by an issue i created to fabric carpet.[Not Released]

`concretePowderDoConvert`: got the idea from OSTC Lab.[Not Released]

`moreDragonFightLogs`: 

Now your console is clean.

`shulkersPostGeneration`:

A feature that Mojang added in a higher version.

`creativePlayersLoadChunks`: 

literal meaning.

`dragonCrashingFix`: 

Fixed the path find and the dragon breath. The server won't crash anymore and you can freeze the dragon freely if you enable this!(you don't have to worry about placing wrong nodes)


`doDragonFightNBTTagSave`: 

Enable this to prevent the dragon fight NBT tags from being saved.


`autoDisableLegacyDragonFightScan`: 

Disable this to make the game check the dragon fight status more than once. You need to restart the server to make it work.

WARNING! the debug logs might spam massivly into your console!

`dispenserCrashFix`: 

Fixes the problem that when you try to place a shulker box above/below the build height limit, the server will crash.

## To-do list

**Settings:**


`survivalPlayersLoadChunks`: Uh-uh.

`netherPortalLoadChunks`: I did try to build portal chunk loaders in 1.12.2, and I was wondering why it didn't work.

`pearlLoadChunks`: I added this in 1.15.2 carpet mod.


**Commands: **

`/nbtset <path> <value>`: its tough work.

`/data <get, merge, modify, remove> ...`: WE NEED IT...Uh, yes, we need it.
